/**
 * MarkdownEditor — a controlled monospace <textarea> for the resume source,
 * with editor quality-of-life features (#61).
 *
 * It stays a real <textarea> underneath — no contenteditable, no editor
 * library, no new dependencies. The added chrome is layered around it:
 *
 *  - Line-number gutter: a scroll-synced, `aria-hidden` column of line
 *    numbers rendered beside the textarea.
 *  - Soft-wrap toggle: switches the textarea's `wrap` attribute (and the
 *    matching `white-space`) between wrapped and off; remembered for the
 *    session via sessionStorage.
 *  - Section snippets: a single "Insert section" menu offering resume
 *    section skeletons inserted at the caret, ordered by where each
 *    section appears in the canonical document layout (#154).
 *
 * Every keystroke is still emitted up to ResumeStudio, which debounces
 * re-parsing. The editor holds no parsing logic.

       - jumpToOffender(line, offender): like jumpToLine, but selects the
         offender substring on that line (so the highlight reads as "this
         is the bit to change", not "this whole line is wrong").
       - insertRewriteAboveLine(targetLine, rewrittenLine): insert a new
         bullet line directly above the original, going through the same
         value/onChange path the in-editor rewrite tray (#93) uses.
       - jumpToSection(sectionTitle): scroll to and select the H2 heading
         whose title matches. Powers Health's "Open an example" affordance.

     Lines are 1-based to match what the analyzer emits. We clamp into range
     so a finding referring to a now-deleted line still does something
     sensible (snap to the nearest valid line).

     `value` and `onChange` live in the dependency array of the handle so a
     ref consumer always sees the live document — without this the insert
     callback would close over a stale `value` and clobber later edits. */

          / Sublime / IntelliJ. The `●` dot prefix appears when the
          buffer is dirty relative to the last-loaded baseline.

          The JSX is a `<ul>` deliberately — multi-tab support (snapshots
          as tabs, #94 follow-on) is a future possibility, and starting
          with a list keeps the markup forward-compatible without forcing
          the work today. Today only one `<li>` is ever rendered, but the
          CSS targets the list shape rather than a single element so
          adding more later won't require any restyling.

          The Replace file / Clear actions move here from the uploader's
          collapsed bar (#138 constraint: don't break those affordances).

          Appears only when the caret is on an Experience bullet that has
          at least one applicable rewrite. Renders below the textarea —
          a single trigger button that opens a tray of 2-3 candidate
          rewrites. ESC closes the tray and returns focus to the trigger.
          A click on a candidate inserts a new sibling bullet above the
          original through the same value/onChange path as the snippet
          inserter, so there's no separate state-mutation pathway.

          #203: like the Insert-section list, this tray is click-only and
          never implemented arrow-key roving, so `role="menu"` /
          `role="menuitem"` was a false ARIA contract. It is a labelled
          `role="group"` of plain buttons; Escape still closes it and
          restores trigger focus. */}
