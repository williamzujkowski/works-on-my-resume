/**
 * gist.ts — explicit, user-initiated import from a public GitHub Gist (#33).
 *
 * THE ONLY NETWORK CALL IN THIS APP THAT CARRIES NO RESUME DATA OUTBOUND
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The privacy posture of Works on My Resume is "nothing leaves the browser
 * unless the user explicitly asks". This module is the carefully-scoped
 * exception: when (and only when) the user pastes a gist URL and clicks
 * Import, we issue a single GET to GitHub's public Gists API. We:
 *
 *   - Send NO request body, NO custom headers beyond `Accept`, and NO auth.
 *     The endpoint is anonymous; the gist must be public.
 *   - Do not pass any resume content outbound — the request URL is just
 *     `https://api.github.com/gists/<id>`. The response is the gist body,
 *     which the user has chosen to import.
 *   - Surface friendly errors for the three failure modes that actually
 *     happen in practice: network down, gist not found / private (404),
 *     and the unauthenticated rate limit (403).
 *
 * The matching CSP relaxation (a single `https://api.github.com` entry in
 * the `connect-src` directive) lives in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`.
