/**
 * toolbar-rhythm.spec.ts — locks in the #135 visual contract.
 *
 * The toolbar dropped its pill outlines and adopted a kicker + value
 * rhythm with hairline separators:
 *
 *   THEME  <name> ▾  │  LAYOUT  Classic Modern Compact  │  FIT  1.4p  │
 *     [Save as PDF]  │  Export ▾  │  ⚙
 *
 * Acceptance:
 *   1. At 1280×800, at least three visible kicker labels (THEME, LAYOUT,
 *      FIT) read in the toolbar.
 *   2. Save-as-PDF is the ONLY `.btn--primary` in the toolbar — every
 *      other control reads as text-with-affordance.
 *   3. The hairline separators (`.studio__toolbar-sep`) are present —
 *      at least one is in the DOM — so the grouping is conveyed
 *      visually. Visibility is asserted via `offsetParent !== null`
 *      so a 1-px wide element is still counted (offsetWidth on a
 *      single-px element is reported as 1, but the layout-shrink
 *      case where width truncates to 0 is rare and we'd rather not
 *      depend on offsetWidth-floor heuristics).
 *
 * Mobile is out of scope: the More menu (#131) reshapes the toolbar
 * into a column drawer, so the hairlines collapse with the rest of the
 * collapsible controls. The desktop project carries the rhythm.

     can drift one or two if a future PR rearranges groups, so we assert
